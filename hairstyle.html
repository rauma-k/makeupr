				<p>IT Cosmetics CC+ Cream
				This is the daddy of tinted moisturizers. It has a thick, rich texture that I prefer to buff into my skin with a brush, and it boasts the highest coverage of any tinted moisturizer I’ve tried. It also dries to a middle-of-the-road finish—not super dewy, but not exactly matte, either. IT Cosmetics recently expanded the shade range to 12 shades to accommodate a wider variety of skin tones, so most folks will be able to find a shade that works for them. A good choice if you want the ease of a tinted moisturizer without sacrificing coverage.</p>

Kevyn Aucoin Stripped Nude Skin Tint
Next up in terms of coverage is Kevyn Aucoin’s Stripped Nude Skin Tint. While still sheer, it’s buildable, so I can layer it on top of dark spots and acne scars to make them less apparent. The texture is creamy but lightweight with good slippage, making it easy to blend with just your fingers. It also doesn’t sink into fine lines or emphasize skin texture, which is my main gripe with tinted moisturizers. If I need a foolproof, unfussy tinted moisturizer, this is what I turn to</p>

				<p>ILIA Super Serum Skin Tint
ILIA’s Super Serum Skin Tint is what happens when a serum meets a tinted moisturizer and they have a baby. The texture is liquidy and lightly emollient, making it easy to apply with your fingers for a sheer veil of coverage with a dewy finish. I especially like this tint because it’s packed with skincare ingredients I normally use like squalane, niacinamide, and two types of hyaluronic acid. It also has SPF 40, although I always apply my normal sunscreen underneath for better protection. I’d recommend this to anyone who appreciates clean ingredients and wants a sheer-coverage product that actually moisturizes.</p>
