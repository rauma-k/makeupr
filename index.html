				<h2>Hello</h2>

					Have you ever tried to follow an eye makeup tutorial and found that it just didn’t work with your eyes? For those of us without double eyelids (more on that in a second), it’s a common occurrence. If you’re struggling to get your eye makeup right—and popular techniques just don’t seem to make sense—it may help to learn what type of eyelids you possess

						What application style is best for you?
Depending on your eyelids, you may have to alter the way you do your eye makeup for best results. If you have monolids, for example, you may not have a visible crease to define with eye shadow. Instead, try sweeping shadow along your upper lashes to define your eye.

If you have hooded eyes, most winged eyeliner tips and tricks don’t work due to that extra fold of skin. Instead, try relaxing your eye and sketching your wing over the fold without pulling the skin taut.

With double lids, you have some lid space to work with. Use a dark shade to define the crease of your eye and add depth to your look. If your lids are oily, applying a primer and then lightly dab your lids with setting powder. That can help keep your shadow from creasing.

Now that you know if you have double lids, monolids, or hooded lids, you’re one step closer to finding the technique that works for you.

						You’ve probably heard about the different eye shapes (round, almond, deep-set, upturned—we could go on), but eyelids are another story. Here, we break down the difference between double eyelids, monolids and hooded eyelids so that you can tweak your technique for your unique eyes.
