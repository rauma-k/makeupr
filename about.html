		<h3>about us</h3>
		
		<p>
			Doing our makeup is the something most women and men look forward to doing in the morning. There are so many looks you can achieve and it is a very enjoyable process.
Make up is all about creativity so let your creative side shine. If you want to do a bold red lip and some sparkly eyes then do it there are no wrongs and right when it comes to makeup. 
We here in this space don't think of makeup as a cover up or hiding imperfections rather it's about enhancing them and taking your flaws and working with them. 
With our new makeup line we made sure that there  something every one from beginners to professionals and we will do a little sneak peak on our instagram so do follow us there.

Rauma Flawless Finish Filter
Get starlit skin in seconds with Rauma Flawless Filter, the customizable complexion booster that’s a primer, highlighter, and luminous mixing medium in one. Like a skin-perfecting digital filter in a bottle, Hollywood Flawless Filter can be used in four different ways to blur imperfections, smooth lines and pores, and illuminate the skin with a dewy, soft-focus glow.

“It’s the ultimate high-gloss, high-glow, celebrity-skin filter in a bottle! You can wear my Hollywood Flawless Filter under foundation, instead of foundation, or on top of foundation in the areas where you want to glow the most.” — Charlotte

Why It’s Special
Achieve dewy, luminous celebrity skin with the formula Charlotte has been secretly testing on the red carpet for over 25 years
Smoothing airbrush polymers and finely milled powders roll over skin with a creamy texture, minimizing the look of imperfections on camera and in real life
Infused with Glossy Oil, a lightweight moisturizing oil that reflects light off the high points of the face with a high-shine finish
Porcelain Flower Extract enhances microcirculation and brightens skin while providing antioxidant and anti-inflammatory support
How to Use
For a subtle glow, apply using the doe-foot applicator under the eyes and on the nose and chin. Blend with fingers and apply foundation on top. For an amplified glow, blend with foundation on the back of your hand and apply with a buffing brush. For a targeted glow, dot along the cheekbones, down the nose, and on the cupid’s bow on top of the foundation. For an all-over glow, buff into skin with a foundation brush and finish with concealer.
